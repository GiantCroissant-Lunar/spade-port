version: 0.1.0

skills:
  - dotnet-build

goals:
  - Produce deterministic, reproducible builds
  - Ensure all dependencies restored correctly
  - Generate build artifacts (binaries, packages)
  - Report build warnings and errors clearly

constraints:
  - Work only within ./dotnet directory
  - Never commit build artifacts (bin/, obj/)
  - Ensure builds are idempotent

success_criteria:
  - 'Build succeeds with zero errors'
  - 'Artifacts generated in expected output path'
  - 'Build logs attached with full context'
  - 'Dependencies restored successfully'
