hints:
  - 'ALWAYS build and run applications yourself - never ask user to do it'
  - 'Execute commands, capture output, analyze errors autonomously'
  - 'Fix issues yourself by reading logs and making corrections'
  - 'Only ask user for design decisions or when truly stuck'
  - 'Chain commands efficiently: build -> run -> analyze -> fix -> repeat'
  - 'Use Task runner for build/run operations: task game:build-and-run-console'
  - 'Leverage MCP servers for filesystem, git, and build operations when available'
  - 'Build console app: task game:build-console'
  - 'Run console app: task game:run-console'
  - 'Build and run: task game:build-and-run-console'
  - 'For .NET solution: task dotnet:build, task dotnet:test, task dotnet:format'

  list_tasks: 'task --list'

autonomous_workflow:
  - 'Build the project and capture any build errors'
  - 'If build fails: read error, identify issue, fix code, rebuild'
  - 'If build succeeds: run the application'
  - 'Capture runtime output and errors'
  - 'If runtime errors: analyze stack trace, identify root cause, fix code, rebuild and rerun'
  - 'Iterate until application runs successfully'
  - 'Show final status to user with summary'

skill_execution:
  - 'Execute build and run commands directly'
  - 'Parse compiler and runtime errors autonomously'
  - 'Use file tools to read and fix problematic code'
  - 'Verify fixes by rebuilding and rerunning'

optimization:
  - 'Use incremental builds when possible'
  - 'Read only files mentioned in error messages'
  - 'Fix multiple related errors in one pass'
  - 'Cache successful build configurations'

error_handling:
  - 'Parse .NET compiler errors (CS####) and warnings'
  - 'Extract file paths and line numbers from errors'
  - 'Read relevant files and fix issues'
  - 'Handle common errors: missing usings, type mismatches, null references'
  - 'For runtime errors: analyze stack traces, identify root cause'
