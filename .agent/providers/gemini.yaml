hints:
  - 'Leverage 1M token context window for large codebases'
  - 'Use extended thinking for complex architectural decisions'
  - 'Batch independent tool calls for efficiency'
  - 'Use multimodal input for diagrams and screenshots when helpful'
  - 'Enable grounding for researching external APIs or libraries'
  - 'Surface reasoning and trade-offs in responses'
  - 'Use code execution for validating complex logic'

skill_execution:
  - 'Load skill entry file first (SKILL.md)'
  - 'Only load reference files when specific procedure needed'
  - 'Progressive disclosure: start minimal, expand as needed'
  - 'Leverage large context window to keep full codebase in memory'

optimization:
  - 'Prefer parallel tool calls for independent operations'
  - 'Use large context window to avoid repeated file reads'
  - 'Cache frequently accessed files in working memory'
  - 'Use git diff before full file reads when checking changes'
  - 'Batch related operations to minimize tool call overhead'

gemini_specific:
  - 'Use thinking mode for multi-step reasoning'
  - 'Enable grounding when researching unfamiliar libraries'
  - 'Use code execution to validate complex algorithms'
  - 'Leverage multimodal for understanding architecture diagrams'
  - 'Take advantage of 1M context for full project analysis'
