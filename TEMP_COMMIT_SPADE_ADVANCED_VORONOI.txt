Spade.Advanced: clipped Voronoi and centroidal relaxation

- Add Spade.Advanced extension library with Voronoi helpers:
  - ClipPolygon, ClippedVoronoiCell, ClippedVoronoiDiagram
  - ClippedVoronoiBuilder for clipping Voronoi cells to a convex convex domain
  - CentroidalVoronoiRelaxation.RelaxPoints helper for Lloyd-style smoothing
- Add advanced tests for clipped Voronoi and centroidal relaxation
- Wire Spade.Tests to reference Spade.Advanced
- Document clipped Voronoi usage in USAGE.md
- Add RFC-008, RFC-009, RFC-010 to describe advanced Voronoi, validation with Julia, and extensions project structure
- Update RFC-006 / RFC-007 and core Spade types (DCEL, LineIntersectionIterator, TriangulationBase, VoronoiFace) as part of phase 5 integration / infinite loop fixes
